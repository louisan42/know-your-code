<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

*Know Your Code* is an ‘advanced cheat sheet’ which outline common general/interview questions and basic syntax. It is essentially an updated version of [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) with a better UI, more languages, frameworks and technologies (which will be implemented in due course). 

Here's the benefits for Know Your Code compared to other 'cheat sheets':
* The project is open sourced.
* The project outlines interview/general questions about technologies and syntax-styled questions.

Of course, the project _is_ in early stages and therefore you may experience bugs or errors. Please open an issue if you feel the need to so. Also note that more technologies will be added to the topic list in time.
